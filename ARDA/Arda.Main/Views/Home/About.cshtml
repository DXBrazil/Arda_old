<p>
    Today is very important to measure the things. This need applies to all different areas in a company. In addition,
    receiving an optimized vision about resources allocation between different projects and individual workloads is critical
    for all (both the resources and their managers) because it allows the team to organize their routines, equalize work/life
    balance and being more effective in the deliverables.

    Furthermore, how Technical Evangelists (TE’s) that maintain the focus on cloud computing scenarios and frequently need
    to show different aspects of our cloud platform to our customers and partners in events and such, develop one web and
    mobile tool that uses completely our stack of technologies and it is delivered in the cloud could be very impactful to
    the team and to the community. This process could be very helpful for us in order to improve our technical skills.
</p>

<p>
    The external community engagement with Microsoft is another aspect that a development of a tool like that can be helpful. If this 
    project is open source (and we have intent to do this) we can work with external communities in order to request their 
    collaboration with us during all the development process. Perhaps it could be a great entry port to us.

    Arda emerges like a good answer to this this questions. Our goal is highly concentered to use this process (development) and tool 
    to address all this different needs, including some impact in our scorecard.

<h1 style="margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:20px;">Problems statement</h1>

<p>Understand the team needs is fundamental to create a pragmatic solution to solve it. This way, the follow items show de main needs 
mapped.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Measure the team’s capacity</strong>: witch is the real delivery capacity of team? The answer to this question isn’t 
        easy to be found. The great problem here is in fact of how to collect data with accuracy. This aspect is very important to 
        provide to managers a right vision about team capacity.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Workloads distribution</strong>: this is another problem to solve. When managers can’t see clearly the work/projects 
        distribution between team member’s wrong allocations can occur. This fact implies the team unbalancing.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Engagement with external technical communities</strong>: in order amplifies the Microsoft Technologies to reach 
        outside our boundaries, we need to find some way to engage with other communities: Microsoft and non-Microsoft and invite 
        then to collaborate with us in open source projects and related initiatives. This will be very impactful for us like 
        evangelists.
    </li>
